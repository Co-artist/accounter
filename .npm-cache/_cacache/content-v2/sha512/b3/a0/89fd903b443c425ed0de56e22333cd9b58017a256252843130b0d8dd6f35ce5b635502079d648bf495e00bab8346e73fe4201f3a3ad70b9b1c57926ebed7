Build high-performance animations that work in **every** major browser. Animate CSS, SVG, canvas, React, Vue, WebGL, colors, strings, motion paths, generic objects... anything JavaScript can touch! GSAP's <a href=\"https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger/\">ScrollTrigger</a> plugin delivers jaw-dropping scroll-based animations with minimal code. <a href=\"https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/gsap.matchMedia()\">gsap.matchMedia()</a> makes building responsive, accessibility-friendly animations a breeze.\n\nNo other library delivers such advanced sequencing, reliability, and tight control while solving real-world problems on over 12 million sites. GSAP works around countless browser inconsistencies; your animations ***just work***. At its core, GSAP is a high-speed property manipulator, updating values over time with extreme accuracy. It's up to 20x faster than jQuery!\n\nGSAP is completely flexible; sprinkle it wherever you want. **Zero dependencies.**\n\nThere are many optional <a href=\"https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins\">plugins</a> and <a href=\"https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Eases\">easing</a> functions for achieving advanced effects easily like <a href=\"https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger/\">scrolling</a>, <a href=\"https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/MorphSVGPlugin\">morphing</a>, [text splitting](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/SplitText), animating along a <a href=\"https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/MotionPathPlugin\">motion path</a> or <a href=\"https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/Flip/\">FLIP</a> animations. There's even a handy <a href=\"https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/Observer/\">Observer</a> for normalizing event detection across browsers/devices. \n\n\n### Get Started\n\n[![Get Started with GSAP](https://gsap.com/_img/github/get-started.jpg)](https://gsap.com/get-started)\n\n\n## Docs &amp; Installation\n\nView the <a href=\"https://gsap.com/docs\">full documentation here</a>, including an <a href=\"https://gsap.com/install\">installation guide</a>.\n\n### CDN\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/gsap@3.14/dist/gsap.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nSee <a href=\"https://www.jsdelivr.com/gsap\">JSDelivr's dedicated GSAP page</a> for quick CDN links to the core files/plugins. There are more <a href=\"https://gsap.com/install\">installation instructions</a> at gsap.com.\n\n**Every major ad network excludes GSAP from file size calculations** and most have it on their own CDNs, so contact them for the appropriate URL(s). \n\n### NPM\nSee the <a href=\"https://gsap.com/install\">guide to using GSAP via NPM here</a>.\n\n```javascript\nnpm install gsap\n```\n\nGSAP's core can animate almost anything including CSS and attributes, plus it includes all of the <a href=\"https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/UtilityMethods\">utility methods</a> like <a href=\"https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/UtilityMethods/interpolate()\">interpolate()</a>, <a href=\"https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/UtilityMethods/mapRange()\">mapRange()</a>, most of the <a href=\"https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Eases\">eases</a>, and it can do snapping and modifiers. \n\n```javascript\n// typical import\nimport gsap from \"gsap\";\n\n// get other plugins:\nimport ScrollTrigger from \"gsap/ScrollTrigger\";\nimport Flip from \"gsap/Flip\";\nimport Draggable from \"gsap/Draggable\";\n\n// or all tools are exported from the \"all\" file (excluding members-only plugins):\nimport { gsap, ScrollTrigger, Draggable, MotionPathPlugin } from \"gsap/all\";\n\n// don't forget to register plugins\ngsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger, Draggable, Flip, MotionPathPlugin); \n```\n\nThe NPM files are ES modules, but there's also a /dist/ directory with <a href=\"https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2014/what-is-amd-commonjs-and-umd/\">UMD</a> files for extra compatibility.\n\n## GSAP is FREE! \n\nThanks to [Webflow](https://webflow.com), GSAP is now **100% FREE** including ALL of the bonus plugins like [SplitText](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/SplitText), [MorphSVG](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/MorphSVGPlugin), and all the others that were exclusively available to Club GSAP members. That's right - the entire GSAP toolset is FREE, even for commercial use! 🤯  Read more [here](https://webflow.com/blog/gsap-becomes-free)\n\n### ScrollTrigger &amp; ScrollSmoother\n\nIf you're looking for scroll-driven animations, GSAP's <a href=\"https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger/\">ScrollTrigger</a> plugin is the standard. There's a companion <a href=\"https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollSmoother/\">ScrollSmoother</a> as well.\n\n[![ScrollTrigger](https://gsap.com/_img/github/scrolltrigger.jpg)](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger)\n\n### Using React? \n\nThere's a <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gsap/react\">@gsap/react</a> package that exposes a `useGSAP()` hook which is a drop-in replacement for `useEffect()`/`useLayoutEffect()`, automating cleanup tasks. Please read the <a href=\"https://gsap.com/react\">React guide</a> for details.\n\n### Resources\n\n* <a href=\"https://gsap.com/\">gsap.com</a>\n* <a href=\"https://gsap.com/get-started/\">Getting started guide</a>\n* <a href=\"https://gsap.com/docs/\">Docs</a>\n* <a href=\"https://gsap.com/demos\">Demos &amp; starter templates</a>\n* <a href=\"https://gsap.com/community/\">Community forums</a>\n* <a href=\"https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Eases\">Ease Visualizer</a>\n* <a href=\"https://gsap.com/showcase\">Showcase</a>\n* <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@GreenSockLearning\">YouTube Channel</a>\n* <a href=\"https://gsap.com/cheatsheet\">Cheat sheet</a>\n* <a href=\"https://webflow.com\">Webflow</a>\n\n### Need help?\nAsk in the friendly <a href=\"https://gsap.com/community/\">GSAP forums</a>.
