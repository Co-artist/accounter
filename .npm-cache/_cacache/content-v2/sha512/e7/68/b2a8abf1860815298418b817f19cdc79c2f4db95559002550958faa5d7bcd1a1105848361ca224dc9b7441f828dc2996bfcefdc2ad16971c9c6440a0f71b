Capacitor Updater solves this by:\n\n- **Instant updates** - Push JavaScript/HTML/CSS updates directly to users without app store review\n- **Delta updates** - Only download changed files, making updates ultra-fast\n- **Rollback protection** - Automatically revert broken updates to keep your app stable\n- **Open source** - Self-host or use Capgo Cloud, with full control over your update infrastructure\n- **Battle-tested** - Used by 3000+ production apps with proven reliability\n- **Most stared** - Capacitor updater is the most stared Capacitor plugin on GitHub\n\nPerfect for fixing bugs immediately, A/B testing features, and maintaining control over your release schedule.\n\n## Features\n\n- ☁️ Cloud / Self hosted Support: Use our [Cloud](https://capgo.app/) to manage your app updates or yours.\n- 📦 Bundle Management: Download, assign to channel, rollback.\n- 📺 Channel Support: Use channels to manage different environments.\n- 🎯 Set Channel to specific device to do QA or debug one user.\n- 🔄 Auto Update: Automatically download and set the latest bundle for the app.\n- 🛟 Rollback: Reset the app to last working bundle if an incompatible bundle has been set.\n- 🔁 **Delta Updates**: Make instant updates by only downloading changed files.\n- 🔒 **Security**: Encrypt and sign each updates with best in class security standards.\n- ⚔️ **Battle-Tested**: Used in more than 3000 projects.\n- 📊 View your deployment statistics\n- 🔋 Supports Android and iOS\n- ⚡️ Capacitor 6/7 support\n- 🌐 **Open Source**: Licensed under the Mozilla Public License 2.0\n- 🌐 **Open Source Backend**: Self install [our backend](https://github.com/Cap-go/capgo) in your infra\n\n\nYou have 3 ways possible :\n- Use [capgo.app](https://capgo.app) a full featured auto-update system in 5 min Setup, to manage version, update, revert and see stats.\n- Use your own server update with auto-update system\n- Use manual methods to zip, upload, download, from JS to do it when you want.\n\n## Documentation\nThe most complete [documentation here](https://capgo.app/docs/).\n\n## Community\nJoin the [discord](https://discord.gg/VnYRvBfgA6) to get help.\n\n## Migration to v8\n\n## Migration to v7.34\n\n- **Channel storage change**: `setChannel()` now stores channel assignments locally on the device instead of in the cloud. This provides better offline support and reduces backend load.\n  - Channel assignments persist between app restarts\n  - Use `unsetChannel()` to clear the local assignment and revert to `defaultChannel`\n  - Old devices (< v7.34.0) will continue using cloud-based storage\n- **New event**: Listen to the `channelPrivate` event to handle cases where a user tries to assign themselves to a private channel (one that doesn't allow self-assignment). See example in the `setChannel()` documentation above.\n\n## Migration to v7\n\nThe min version of IOS is now 15.5 instead of 15 as Capacitor 8 requirement.\nThis is due to bump of ZipArchive to latest, a key dependency of this project is the zlib library. zlib before version 1.2.12 allows memory corruption when deflating (i.e., when compressing) if the input has many distant matches according to [CVE-2018-25032](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2018-25032).\nzlib is a native library so we need to bump the minimum iOS version to 15.5 as ZipArchive did the same in their latest versions.\n\n## Compatibility\n\n| Plugin version | Capacitor compatibility | Maintained        |\n| -------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------- |\n| v8.\\*.\\*       | v8.\\*.\\*                | Beta                 |\n| v7.\\*.\\*       | v7.\\*.\\*                | ✅                 |\n| v6.\\*.\\*       | v6.\\*.\\*                | ✅                 |\n| v5.\\*.\\*       | v5.\\*.\\*                | ⚠️ Deprecated |\n| v4.\\*.\\*       | v4.\\*.\\*                | ⚠️ Deprecated |\n| v3.\\*.\\*       | v3.\\*.\\*                | ⚠️ Deprecated     |\n| > 7            | v4.\\*.\\*                | ⚠️ Deprecated, our CI got crazy and bumped too much version     |\n\n### iOS\n\n#### Privacy manifest\n\nAdd the `NSPrivacyAccessedAPICategoryUserDefaults` dictionary key to your [Privacy Manifest](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/ios/privacy-manifest) (usually `ios/App/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`):\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n  <dict>\n    <key>NSPrivacyAccessedAPITypes</key>\n    <array>\n      <!-- Add this dict entry to the array if the file already exists. -->\n      <dict>\n        <key>NSPrivacyAccessedAPIType</key>\n        <string>NSPrivacyAccessedAPICategoryUserDefaults</string>\n        <key>NSPrivacyAccessedAPITypeReasons</key>\n        <array>\n          <string>CA92.1</string>\n        </array>\n      </dict>\n    </array>\n  </dict>\n</plist>\n```\n\nWe recommend to declare [`CA92.1`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files/describing_use_of_required_reason_api#4278401) as the reason for accessing the [`UserDefaults`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/userdefaults) API.\n\n## Installation\n\nStep by step here: [Getting started](https://capgo.app/docs/getting-started/add-an-app/)\n\nOr\n\n```bash\nnpm install @capgo/capacitor-updater\nnpx cap sync\n```\n\n## Auto-update setup\n\nCreate your account in [capgo.app](https://capgo.app) and get your [API key](https://console.capgo.app/dashboard/apikeys)\n- Login to CLI `npx @capgo/cli@latest init API_KEY`\nAnd follow the steps by step to setup your app.\n\nFor detailed instructions on the auto-update setup, refer to the [Auto update documentation](https://capgo.app/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/getting-started/).\n\n\n## No Cloud setup\n\nDownload update distribution zipfiles from a custom URL. Manually control the entire update process.\n\n- Edit your `capacitor.config.json` like below, set `autoUpdate` to false.\n```json\n// capacitor.config.json\n{\n\t\"appId\": \"**.***.**\",\n\t\"appName\": \"Name\",\n\t\"plugins\": {\n\t\t\"CapacitorUpdater\": {\n\t\t\t\"autoUpdate\": false,\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n- Add to your main code\n```javascript\n  import { CapacitorUpdater } from '@capgo/capacitor-updater'\n  CapacitorUpdater.notifyAppReady()\n```\nThis informs Capacitor Updater that the current update bundle has loaded successfully. Failing to call this method will cause your application to be rolled back to the previously successful version (or built-in bundle).\n- Add this to your application.\n```javascript\n  const version = await CapacitorUpdater.download({\n    version: '0.0.4',\n    url: 'https://github.com/Cap-go/demo-app/releases/download/0.0.4/dist.zip',\n  })\n  await CapacitorUpdater.set(version); // sets the new version, and reloads the app\n```\n- Failed updates will automatically roll back to the last successful version.\n- Example: Using App-state to control updates, with SplashScreen:\nYou might also consider performing auto-update when application state changes, and using the Splash Screen to improve user experience.\n```javascript\n  import { CapacitorUpdater, VersionInfo } from '@capgo/capacitor-updater'\n  import { SplashScreen } from '@capacitor/splash-screen'\n  import { App } from '@capacitor/app'\n\n  let version: VersionInfo;\n  App.addListener('appStateChange', async (state) => {\n      if (state.isActive) {\n        // Ensure download occurs while the app is active, or download may fail\n        version = await CapacitorUpdater.download({\n          version: '0.0.4',\n          url: 'https://github.com/Cap-go/demo-app/releases/download/0.0.4/dist.zip',\n        })\n      }\n\n      if (!state.isActive && version) {\n        // Activate the update when the application is sent to background\n        SplashScreen.show()\n        try {\n          await CapacitorUpdater.set(version);\n          // At this point, the new version should be active, and will need to hide the splash screen\n        } catch () {\n          SplashScreen.hide() // Hide the splash screen again if something went wrong\n        }\n      }\n  })\n\n```\n\nTIP: If you prefer a secure and automated way to update your app, you can use [capgo.app](https://capgo.app) - a full-featured, auto-update system.\n\n### Store Guideline Compliance\n\nAndroid Google Play and iOS App Store have corresponding guidelines that have rules you should be aware of before integrating the Capacitor-updater solution within your application.\n\n#### Google play\n\nThird paragraph of [Device and Network Abuse](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9888379?hl=en) topic describe that updating source code by any method besides Google Play's update mechanism is restricted. But this restriction does not apply to updating JavaScript bundles.\n> This restriction does not apply to code that runs in a virtual machine and has limited access to Android APIs (such as JavaScript in a web view or browser).\n\nThat fully allow Capacitor-updater as it updates just JS bundles and can't update native code part.\n\n#### App Store\n\nParagraph **3.3.2**, since back in 2015's [Apple Developer Program License Agreement](https://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/information/) fully allowed performing over-the-air updates of JavaScript and assets.\n\nAnd in its latest version (20170605) [downloadable here](https://developer.apple.com/terms/) this ruling is even broader:\n\n> Interpreted code may be downloaded to an Application, but only so long as such code:\n- (a) does not change the primary purpose of the Application by providing features or functionality that are inconsistent with the intended and advertised purpose of the Application as submitted to the App Store\n- (b) does not create a store or storefront for other code or applications\n- (c) does not bypass signing, sandbox, or other security features of the OS.\n\nCapacitor-updater allows you to respect these rules in full compliance, so long as the update you push does not significantly deviate your product from its original App Store approved intent.\n\nTo further remain in compliance with Apple's guidelines, we suggest that App Store-distributed apps don't enable the `Force update` scenario, since in the [App Store Review Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/) it is written that:\n\n> Apps must not force users to rate the app, review the app, download other apps, or other similar actions to access functionality, content, or use of the app.\n\nThis is not a problem for the default behavior of background update, since it won't force the user to apply the new version until the next app close, but at least you should be aware of that ruling if you decide to show it.\n\n### Packaging `dist.zip` update bundles\n\nCapacitor Updater works by unzipping a compiled app bundle to the native device filesystem. Whatever you choose to name the file you upload/download from your release/update server URL (via either manual or automatic updating), this `.zip` bundle must meet the following requirements:\n\n- The zip file should contain the full contents of your production Capacitor build output folder, usually `{project directory}/dist/` or `{project directory}/www/`. This is where `index.html` will be located, and it should also contain all bundled JavaScript, CSS, and web resources necessary for your app to run.\n- Do not password encrypt the bundle zip file, or it will fail to unpack.\n- Make sure the bundle does not contain any extra hidden files or folders, or it may fail to unpack.\n\n## Updater Plugin Config\n\n<docgen-config>\n<!--Update the source file JSDoc comments and rerun docgen to update the docs below-->\n\nCapacitorUpdater can be configured with these options:\n\n| Prop                          | Type                                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Default                                                                       | Since   |\n| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |\n| **`appReadyTimeout`**         | <code>number</code>                                           | Configure the number of milliseconds the native plugin should wait before considering an update 'failed'.

notifyAppReady()\n\n```typescript\nnotifyAppReady() => Promise<AppReadyResult>\n```\n\nNotify the native layer that JavaScript initialized successfully.\n\n**CRITICAL: You must call this method on every app launch to prevent automatic rollback.**\n\nThis is a simple notification to confirm that your bundle's JavaScript loaded and executed.\nThe native web server successfully served the bundle files and your JS runtime started.\nThat's all it checks - nothing more complex.\n\n**What triggers rollback:**\n- NOT calling this method within the timeout (default: 10 seconds)\n- Complete JavaScript failure (bundle won't load at all)\n\n**What does NOT trigger rollback:**\n- Runtime errors after initialization (API failures, crashes, etc.)\n- Network request failures\n- Application logic errors\n\n**IMPORTANT: Call this BEFORE any network requests.**\nDon't wait for APIs, data loading, or async operations. Call it as soon as your\nJavaScript bundle starts executing to confirm the bundle itself is valid.\n\nBest practices:\n- Call immediately in your app entry point (main.js, app component mount, etc.)\n- Don't put it after network calls or heavy initialization\n- Don't wrap it in try/catch with conditions\n- Adjust {@link PluginsConfig.CapacitorUpdater.appReadyTimeout} if you need more time\n\n**Returns:** <code>Promise&lt;<a href=\"#appreadyresult\">AppReadyResult</a>&gt;</code>\n\n--------------------\n\n\n#### setUpdateUrl(...)\n\n```typescript\nsetUpdateUrl(options: UpdateUrl) => Promise<void>\n```\n\nSet the update URL for the app dynamically at runtime.\n\nThis overrides the {@link PluginsConfig.CapacitorUpdater.updateUrl} config value.\nRequires {@link PluginsConfig.CapacitorUpdater.allowModifyUrl} to be set to `true`.\n\nUse {@link PluginsConfig.CapacitorUpdater.persistModifyUrl} to persist this value across app restarts.\nOtherwise, the URL will reset to the config value on next app launch.\n\n| Param         | Type                                            | Description                                       |\n| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`options`** | <code><a href=\"#updateurl\">UpdateUrl</a></code> | Contains the URL to use for checking for updates. |\n\n**Since:** 5.4.0\n\n--------------------\n\n\n#### setStatsUrl(...)\n\n```typescript\nsetStatsUrl(options: StatsUrl) => Promise<void>\n```\n\nSet the statistics URL for the app dynamically at runtime.\n\nThis overrides the {@link PluginsConfig.CapacitorUpdater.statsUrl} config value.\nRequires {@link PluginsConfig.CapacitorUpdater.allowModifyUrl} to be set to `true`.\n\nPass an empty string to disable statistics gathering entirely.\nUse {@link PluginsConfig.CapacitorUpdater.persistModifyUrl} to persist this value across app restarts.\n\n| Param         | Type                                          | Description                                                                    |\n| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| **`options`** | <code><a href=\"#statsurl\">StatsUrl</a></code> | Contains the URL to use for sending statistics, or an empty string to disable. |\n\n**Since:** 5.4.0\n\n--------------------\n\n\n#### setChannelUrl(...)\n\n```typescript\nsetChannelUrl(options: ChannelUrl) => Promise<void>\n```\n\nSet the channel URL for the app dynamically at runtime.\n\nThis overrides the {@link PluginsConfig.CapacitorUpdater.channelUrl} config value.\nRequires {@link PluginsConfig.CapacitorUpdater.allowModifyUrl} to be set to `true`.\n\nUse {@link PluginsConfig.CapacitorUpdater.persistModifyUrl} to persist this value across app restarts.\nOtherwise, the URL will reset to the config value on next app launch.\n\n| Param         | Type                                              | Description                                     |\n| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |\n| **`options`** | <code><a href=\"#channelurl\">ChannelUrl</a></code> | Contains the URL to use for channel operations. |\n\n**Since:** 5.4.0\n\n--------------------\n\n\n#### download(...)\n\n```typescript\ndownload(options: DownloadOptions) => Promise<BundleInfo>\n```\n\nDownload a new bundle from the provided URL for later installation.\n\nThe downloaded bundle is stored locally but not activated. To use it:\n- Call {@link next} to set it for installation on next app backgrounding/restart\n- Call {@link set} to activate it immediately (destroys current JavaScript context)\n\nThe URL should point to a zip file containing either:\n- Your app files directly in the zip root, or\n- A single folder containing all your app files\n\nThe bundle must include an `index.html` file at the root level.\n\nFor encrypted bundles, provide the `sessionKey` and `checksum` parameters.\nFor multi-file partial updates, provide the `manifest` array.\n\n| Param         | Type                                                        | Description                                                                                  |\n| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`options`** | <code><a href=\"#downloadoptions\">DownloadOptions</a></code> | The {@link <a href=\"#downloadoptions\">DownloadOptions</a>} for downloading a new bundle zip. |\n\n**Returns:** <code>Promise&lt;<a href=\"#bundleinfo\">BundleInfo</a>&gt;</code>\n\n--------------------\n\n\n#### next(...)\n\n```typescript\nnext(options: BundleId) => Promise<BundleInfo>\n```\n\nSet the next bundle to be activated when the app backgrounds or restarts.\n\nThis is the recommended way to apply updates as it doesn't interrupt the user's current session.\nThe bundle will be activated when:\n- The app is backgrounded (user switches away), or\n- The app is killed and relaunched, or\n- {@link reload} is called manually\n\nUnlike {@link set}, this method does NOT destroy the current JavaScript context immediately.\nYour app continues running normally until one of the above events occurs.\n\nUse {@link setMultiDelay} to add additional conditions before the update is applied.\n\n| Param         | Type                                          | Description                                                                                                                 |\n| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`options`** | <code><a href=\"#bundleid\">BundleId</a></code> | Contains the ID of the bundle to set as next. Use {@link <a href=\"#bundleinfo\">BundleInfo.id</a>} from a downloaded bundle. |\n\n**Returns:** <code>Promise&lt;<a href=\"#bundleinfo\">BundleInfo</a>&gt;</code>\n\n--------------------\n\n\n#### set(...)\n\n```typescript\nset(options: BundleId) => Promise<void>\n```\n\nSet the current bundle and immediately reloads the app.\n\n**IMPORTANT: This is a terminal operation that destroys the current JavaScript context.**\n\nWhen you call this method:\n- The entire JavaScript context is immediately destroyed\n- The app reloads from a different folder with different files\n- NO code after this call will execute\n- NO promises will resolve\n- NO callbacks will fire\n- Event listeners registered after this call are unreliable and may never fire\n\nThe reload happens automatically - you don't need to do anything else.\nIf you need to preserve state like the current URL path, use the {@link PluginsConfig.CapacitorUpdater.keepUrlPathAfterReload} config option.\nFor other state preservation needs, save your data before calling this method (e.g., to localStorage).\n\n**Do not** try to execute additional logic after calling `set()` - it won't work as expected.\n\n| Param         | Type                                          | Description                                                                                       |\n| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`options`** | <code><a href=\"#bundleid\">BundleId</a></code> | A {@link <a href=\"#bundleid\">BundleId</a>} object containing the new bundle id to set as current. |\n\n--------------------\n\n\n#### delete(...)\n\n```typescript\ndelete(options: BundleId) => Promise<void>\n```\n\nDelete a bundle from local storage to free up disk space.\n\nYou cannot delete:\n- The currently active bundle\n- The `builtin` bundle (the version shipped with your app)\n- The bundle set as `next` (call {@link next} with a different bundle first)\n\nUse {@link list} to get all available bundle IDs.\n\n**Note:** The bundle ID is NOT the same as the version name.\nUse the `id` field from {@link <a href=\"#bundleinfo\">BundleInfo</a>}, not the `version` field.\n\n| Param         | Type                                          | Description                                                                           |\n| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`options`** | <code><a href=\"#bundleid\">BundleId</a></code> | A {@link <a href=\"#bundleid\">BundleId</a>} object containing the bundle ID to delete. |\n\n--------------------\n\n\n#### setBundleError(...)\n\n```typescript\nsetBundleError(options: BundleId) => Promise<BundleInfo>\n```\n\nManually mark a bundle as failed/errored in manual update mode.\n\nThis is useful when you detect that a bundle has critical issues and want to prevent\nit from being used again. The bundle status will be changed to `error` and the plugin\nwill avoid using this bundle in the future.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- {@link PluginsConfig.CapacitorUpdater.allowManualBundleError} must be set to `true`\n- Only works in manual update mode (when autoUpdate is disabled)\n\nCommon use case: After downloading and testing a bundle, you discover it has critical\nbugs and want to mark it as failed so it won't be retried.\n\n| Param         | Type                                          | Description                                                                                    |\n| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`options`** | <code><a href=\"#bundleid\">BundleId</a></code> | A {@link <a href=\"#bundleid\">BundleId</a>} object containing the bundle ID to mark as errored. |\n\n**Returns:** <code>Promise&lt;<a href=\"#bundleinfo\">BundleInfo</a>&gt;</code>\n\n**Since:** 7.20.0\n\n--------------------\n\n\n#### list(...)\n\n```typescript\nlist(options?: ListOptions | undefined) => Promise<BundleListResult>\n```\n\nGet all locally downloaded bundles stored in your app.\n\nThis returns all bundles that have been downloaded and are available locally, including:\n- The currently active bundle\n- The `builtin` bundle (shipped with your app)\n- Any downloaded bundles waiting to be activated\n- Failed bundles (with `error` status)\n\nUse this to:\n- Check available disk space by counting bundles\n- Delete old bundles with {@link delete}\n- Monitor bundle download status\n\n| Param         | Type                                                | Description                                                                                |\n| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| **`options`** | <code><a href=\"#listoptions\">ListOptions</a></code> | The {@link <a href=\"#listoptions\">ListOptions</a>} for customizing the bundle list output. |\n\n**Returns:** <code>Promise&lt;<a href=\"#bundlelistresult\">BundleListResult</a>&gt;</code>\n\n--------------------\n\n\n#### reset(...)\n\n```typescript\nreset(options?: ResetOptions | undefined) => Promise<void>\n```\n\nReset the app to a known good bundle.\n\nThis method helps recover from problematic updates by reverting to either:\n- The `builtin` bundle (the original version shipped with your app to App Store/Play Store)\n- The last successfully loaded bundle (most recent bundle that worked correctly)\n\n**IMPORTANT: This triggers an immediate app reload, destroying the current JavaScript context.**\nSee {@link set} for details on the implications of this operation.\n\nUse cases:\n- Emergency recovery when an update causes critical issues\n- Testing rollback functionality\n- Providing users a \"reset to factory\" option\n\n| Param         | Type                                                  |\n| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`options`** | <code><a href=\"#resetoptions\">ResetOptions</a></code> |\n\n--------------------\n\n\n#### current()\n\n```typescript\ncurrent() => Promise<CurrentBundleResult>\n```\n\nGet information about the currently active bundle.\n\nReturns:\n- `bundle`: The currently active bundle information\n- `native`: The version of the builtin bundle (the original app version from App/Play Store)\n\nIf no updates have been applied, `bundle.id` will be `\"builtin\"`, indicating the app\nis running the original version shipped with the native app.\n\nUse this to:\n- Display the current version to users\n- Check if an update is currently active\n- Compare against available updates\n- Log the active bundle for debugging\n\n**Returns:** <code>Promise&lt;<a href=\"#currentbundleresult\">CurrentBundleResult</a>&gt;</code>\n\n--------------------\n\n\n#### reload()\n\n```typescript\nreload() => Promise<void>\n```\n\nManually reload the app to apply a pending update.\n\nThis triggers the same reload behavior that happens automatically when the app backgrounds.\nIf you've called {@link next} to queue an update, calling `reload()` will apply it immediately.\n\n**IMPORTANT: This destroys the current JavaScript context immediately.**\nSee {@link set} for details on the implications of this operation.\n\nCommon use cases:\n- Applying an update immediately after download instead of waiting for backgrounding\n- Providing a \"Restart now\" button to users after an update is ready\n- Testing update flows during development\n\nIf no update is pending (no call to {@link next}), this simply reloads the current bundle.\n\n--------------------\n\n\n#### setMultiDelay(...)\n\n```typescript\nsetMultiDelay(options: MultiDelayConditions) => Promise<void>\n```\n\nConfigure conditions that must be met before a pending update is applied.\n\nAfter calling {@link next} to queue an update, use this method to control when it gets applied.\nThe update will only be installed after ALL specified conditions are satisfied.\n\nAvailable condition types:\n- `background`: Wait for the app to be backgrounded. Optionally specify duration in milliseconds.\n- `kill`: Wait for the app to be killed and relaunched (**Note:** Current behavior triggers update immediately on kill, not on next background. This will be fixed in v8.)\n- `date`: Wait until a specific date/time (ISO 8601 format)\n- `nativeVersion`: Wait until the native app is updated to a specific version\n\nCondition value formats:\n- `background`: Number in milliseconds (e.g., `\"300000\"` for 5 minutes), or omit for immediate\n- `kill`: No value needed\n- `date`: ISO 8601 date string (e.g., `\"2025-12-31T23:59:59Z\"`)\n- `nativeVersion`: Version string (e.g., `\"2.0.0\"`)\n\n| Param         | Type                                                                  | Description                                                                                        |\n| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`options`** | <code><a href=\"#multidelayconditions\">MultiDelayConditions</a></code> | Contains the {@link <a href=\"#multidelayconditions\">MultiDelayConditions</a>} array of conditions. |\n\n**Since:** 4.3.0\n\n--------------------\n\n\n#### cancelDelay()\n\n```typescript\ncancelDelay() => Promise<void>\n```\n\nCancel all delay conditions and apply the pending update immediately.\n\nIf you've set delay conditions with {@link setMultiDelay}, this method clears them\nand triggers the pending update to be applied on the next app background or restart.\n\nThis is useful when:\n- User manually requests to update now (e.g., clicks \"Update now\" button)\n- Your app detects it's a good time to update (e.g., user finished critical task)\n- You want to override a time-based delay early\n\n**Since:** 4.0.0\n\n--------------------\n\n\n#### getLatest(...)\n\n```typescript\ngetLatest(options?: GetLatestOptions | undefined) => Promise<LatestVersion>\n```\n\nCheck the update server for the latest available bundle version.\n\nThis queries your configured update URL (or Capgo backend) to see if a newer bundle\nis available for download. It does NOT download the bundle automatically.\n\nThe response includes:\n- `version`: The latest available version identifier\n- `url`: Download URL for the bundle (if available)\n- `breaking`: Whether this update is marked as incompatible (requires native app update)\n- `message`: Optional message from the server\n- `manifest`: File list for partial updates (if using multi-file downloads)\n\nAfter receiving the latest version info, you can:\n1. Compare it with your current version\n2. Download it using {@link download}\n3. Apply it using {@link next} or {@link set}\n\n**Important: Error handling for \"no new version available\"**\n\nWhen the device's current version matches the latest version on the server (i.e., the device is already\nup-to-date), the server returns a 200 response with `error: \"no_new_version_available\"` and\n`message: \"No new version available\"`. **This causes `getLatest()` to throw an error**, even though\nthis is a normal, expected condition.\n\nYou should catch this specific error to handle it gracefully:\n\n```typescript\ntry {\n  const latest = await CapacitorUpdater.getLatest();\n  // New version is available, proceed with download\n} catch (error) {\n  if (error.message === 'No new version available') {\n    // Device is already on the latest version - this is normal\n    console.log('Already up to date');\n  } else {\n    // Actual error occurred\n    console.error('Failed to check for updates:', error);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this scenario, the server:\n- Logs the request with a \"No new version available\" message\n- Sends a \"noNew\" stat action to track that the device checked for updates but was already current (done on the backend)\n\n| Param         | Type                                                          | Description                                                                                          |\n| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`options`** | <code><a href=\"#getlatestoptions\">GetLatestOptions</a></code> | Optional {@link <a href=\"#getlatestoptions\">GetLatestOptions</a>} to specify which channel to check. |\n\n**Returns:** <code>Promise&lt;<a href=\"#latestversion\">LatestVersion</a>&gt;</code>\n\n**Since:** 4.0.0\n\n--------------------\n\n\n#### setChannel(...)\n\n```typescript\nsetChannel(options: SetChannelOptions) => Promise<ChannelRes>\n```\n\nAssign this device to a specific update channel at runtime.\n\nChannels allow you to distribute different bundle versions to different groups of users\n(e.g., \"production\", \"beta\", \"staging\"). This method switches the device to a new channel.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- The target channel must allow self-assignment (configured in your Capgo dashboard or backend)\n- The backend may accept or reject the request based on channel settings\n\n**When to use:**\n- After the app is ready and the user has interacted (e.g., opted into beta program)\n- To implement in-app channel switching (beta toggle, tester access, etc.)\n- For user-driven channel changes\n\n**When NOT to use:**\n- At app boot/initialization - use {@link PluginsConfig.CapacitorUpdater.defaultChannel} config instead\n- Before user interaction\n\n**Important: Listen for the `channelPrivate` event**\n\nWhen a user attempts to set a channel that doesn't allow device self-assignment, the method will\nthrow an error AND fire a {@link addListener}('channelPrivate') event. You should listen to this event\nto provide appropriate feedback to users:\n\n```typescript\nCapacitorUpdater.addListener('channelPrivate', (data) =&gt; {\n  console.warn(`Cannot access channel \"${data.channel}\": ${data.message}`);\n  // Show user-friendly message\n});\n```\n\nThis sends a request to the Capgo backend linking your device ID to the specified channel.\n\n| Param         | Type                                                            | Description                                                                                                                  |\n| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`options`** | <code><a href=\"#setchanneloptions\">SetChannelOptions</a></code> | The {@link <a href=\"#setchanneloptions\">SetChannelOptions</a>} containing the channel name and optional auto-update trigger. |\n\n**Returns:** <code>Promise&lt;<a href=\"#channelres\">ChannelRes</a>&gt;</code>\n\n**Since:** 4.7.0\n\n--------------------\n\n\n#### unsetChannel(...)\n\n```typescript\nunsetChannel(options: UnsetChannelOptions) => Promise<void>\n```\n\nRemove the device's channel assignment and return to the default channel.\n\nThis unlinks the device from any specifically assigned channel, causing it to fall back to:\n- The {@link PluginsConfig.CapacitorUpdater.defaultChannel} if configured, or\n- Your backend's default channel for this app\n\nUse this when:\n- Users opt out of beta/testing programs\n- You want to reset a device to standard update distribution\n- Testing channel switching behavior\n\n| Param         | Type                                                                |\n| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`options`** | <code><a href=\"#unsetchanneloptions\">UnsetChannelOptions</a></code> |\n\n**Since:** 4.7.0\n\n--------------------\n\n\n#### getChannel()\n\n```typescript\ngetChannel() => Promise<GetChannelRes>\n```\n\nGet the current channel assigned to this device.\n\nReturns information about:\n- `channel`: The currently assigned channel name (if any)\n- `allowSet`: Whether the channel allows self-assignment\n- `status`: Operation status\n- `error`/`message`: Additional information (if applicable)\n\nUse this to:\n- Display current channel to users (e.g., \"You're on the Beta channel\")\n- Check if a device is on a specific channel before showing features\n- Verify channel assignment after calling {@link setChannel}\n\n**Returns:** <code>Promise&lt;<a href=\"#getchannelres\">GetChannelRes</a>&gt;</code>\n\n**Since:** 4.8.0\n\n--------------------\n\n\n#### listChannels()\n\n```typescript\nlistChannels() => Promise<ListChannelsResult>\n```\n\nGet a list of all channels available for this device to self-assign to.\n\nOnly returns channels where `allow_self_set` is `true`.
